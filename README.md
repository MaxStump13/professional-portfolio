## Description
I was tasked with updating my professional portfolio to demonstrate personal projects to future employers. The goal was to make a webpage that is visually appealing with access to projects I have completed. Utilizing Bootstrap, I was able to create a structured webpage that is both desktop and mobile friendly. I was able to include images with dropdown menus containing links to my projects and repos. I structured my HTML with semantic elements and alt tags for more accessibility. During the creation of my portfolio, I learned how to use different components of Bootstrap, specifically the dropdown menus and image overlay.

## Usage
Here is the deployed link to my portfolio. [My portfolio](https://maxstump13.github.io/professional-portfolio/) Below is what the site looks like on screens larger than 768px and screens smaller than 768px. 
![Screenshot of my portfolio above 768px](./assets/images/full-size.png)
![Screenshot of my portfolio under 768px](./assets/images/mobile.png)
The navigation follows at the top as you scroll down. The images are clickable to open a dropdown menu. These menus have the links to the repos and the deployed applications. These features are displayed below.

If one of the headers in the navigation is clicked, a scroll animation to that section is triggered. If the Resume header is clicked, another tab is opened to a resume. In the Work section, the images are blurred until hovered over.  At the bottom, my contact information and profiles are listed with active links.
